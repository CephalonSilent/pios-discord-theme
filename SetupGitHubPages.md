# Setting up GitHub Pages for hosting theme files

GitHub Pages allows files involved in a theme to be served 

1. Go to your GitHub repository on the website: https://github.com/stella-chaosclub/pios-discord-theme-rez

2. Go to the repository settings, then under `Code and automation` find the `Pages` tab.

3. In `Source`, choose the `master` branch and `root` folder, then save.
4. Choose a theme if you like, this is just visual so it doesn't matter which one you pick.
5. Wait a few minutes for the website to deploy.
6. Check at https://stella-chaosclub.github.io/pios-discord-theme-rez to see if the website is up. Also check specific files, eg. https://stella-chaosclub.github.io/pios-discord-theme-rez/font/rez.ttf to make sure it's in the correct location.

Now upon downloading `piOSForever.theme.css` from your repository into the themes folder, the rez font should be applied throughout the theme.
